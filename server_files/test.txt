CS352 Spring 2011 Project 2 – DUE DATE: Apr 1 , 2011 at 11:55pm
SYNCHRONIZING FILES BETWEEN CLIENT & SERVER
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
For Project 2, you will extend your project 1 to synchronize all files in a folder between a client and a server. Every
20 seconds, your client will check if there are any updates in the synchronized folder. If so, your client will send
update messages to server. Otherwise, your client will send a Keep-Alive message to server and receive a Keep-
Alive message from server.
Your client should try to keep the socket to server permanently across update rounds. But if the socket is closed
(because of networking failure ...) it will create another connection.
For simplicity, you just need to updates files and discard subfolders in the synchronized folder. Therefore, there
are 3 kinds of updates you need to control: (1) delete a file, (2) create a new file and (3) modify an existing file. For
creating a new file or modifying an existing file, client will send the chunk packets to server for the new file or the
modified file, as you did in the project 1. For deleting a file, client will send a deleting message to server. More
details about updating the synchronized folder will be addressed the next sections.
Besides updating files, your server needs to handle different behaviors of clients. Client may "lie" to server about
chunk size in the chunk packet; or die during sending chunk packets; or forget to send the finished packet. During
sending a file, client detect that the file is modified, then client sends an Abort message and will update the file in
the next round.
PROTOCOL
You will implement a simple protocol to facilitate transfers of large files. Files will be transferred in chunks of little-
endian binary data.
Packet Types
0x0001 : File Chunk
0x0002 : Status Message
0x0003 : Finished / Close File
0x0004 : Abort File
0x0005 : Delete File
File Chunk packets (type 0x0001) will be preceded by a variable-length header with the following fields:
-packet type (2 bytes, little-endian)
-md5 checksum (16 bytes)
-chunk size (4 bytes, little-endian)
-filename length (2 bytes, little-endian)
-filename
* A typical File Chunk packet (assume 8 byte filename, 1024 byte chunk) might look like:
Byte index: 0-1 2-17 18-21
Field: [md5] [size] [filename length]
[type]
22-23
24-31
[filename]
32-1055
[chunk]
* Finished/Closed File packet, Abort File packet, and Delete File packet (assume 8 byte filename, 1024 byte chunk)
might look like:
Byte index: 0-1 2-17
Field: [md5] [filename length]
[type]
18-19
24-27
[filename]
* Status Message packets (type 0x0002) will consist entirely of the following fields:
-packet type (2 bytes, little-endian)
-message code (2 bytes, little-endian)
Message Codes
0x0001 - Status OK
0x0002 – Resend / Checksum Incorrect
0x0004 – Resend / Invalid Chunk Size
0x0008 - Abort after 3 incorrect checksums
0x0010 - Abort after 3 invalid chunks
0x0020 - No File To Delete
0x8000 - Keep Alive Message
COMMAND LINE FORMAT
Client program:
./client <servername> <serverport> <folder name> <chunksize>
Server program:
./server <listenport>
PROGRAM BEHAVIOR
The client program will store the last update status of the synchronized folder specified by <folder name> into a
file named META-DATA in the Current Working Directory. At the first time, the META-DATA file should be sent
from the server to the client. After every 20 seconds, your client will check if there are any updates in the
synchronized folder, by comparing the current information of files in the synchronized folder with the information
in the META-DATA file. If there are updates, your client will send update messages to server, and update the
META-DATA file. Otherwise, your client will send a Keep-Alive message to server and receive a Keep-Alive message
from server.
Detecting changes in the synchronized folder:
The META-DATA file contains information about the synchronized folder after the last update round. Basically, it
has a set of entries, one entry per file and each entry contains the following information:
struct meta_data_entry {
int file_name_length;
char [200] filename;
int file_size;
time_t modified_time;
unsigned char update_status; // 1: Updated ; 0: Not updated
}
If a file exists in the synchronized folder and in the META-DATA file, and it has a new modified time, it means that
this file has been modified since the last update round and need to be updated into the server.
If a file exists in the synchronized folder but not in the META-DATA file, it’s a new file.
If a file exists in the METADATA file, but not in the synchronized folder, this file need to be deleted.
Client-Server communication
The figure 1 and the figure 2 describe the finite-state machines for client and server, respectively. There are 2
phases in client-server communication: the hand-shaking phase right after setting up TCP connection, and then the
updating phase.
1.
Hand-shaking phase
The server is listening on the port <listenport>. It also creates/updates the META-DATA file in the Current Working
Directory by getting files information from the folder “<the Current Working Directory>/data”. If the folder “<the
Current Working Directory>/data” is not existed, it will create one and then create an empty META-DATA file.
The client will then connect to the server with <servername> on port <serverport> using TCP. Upon establishing a
connection, the server will send the METADATA file to the client by only one Chunk packet (S1 in the figure 2).
Upon receiving the METADATA file, client will check MD5 checksum; and send back the Status OK message if the
check sum is OK (C4 in the figure 1). After sending the file, the server will send a "Finished" packet (S4); wait for
another Status OK message from the client and then the updating phase will be starting.
If the checksum for the METADATA file is incorrect, client will send a “Resend” response (C2); and the server will
resend the META-DATA file. After three time of receiving “Resend” responses, server will close the connection to
the client (S3).
2.
Updating phase
After the hand-shaking phase is ok, the client will start the updating phase by sending updates to server every 20
seconds. For creating a new file or modifying an existing file, client will send the chunk packets to server for the
new file, as in the project 1(C9). After receiving a “Finish” packet for a file, server will update its META-DATA file,
and send a Status OK message back to client (S9). Upon receiving this Status OK message, client will update its
META-DATA file.
For each received chunk, the server will compute the MD5 hash of the received data. If the hash does not match,
the server will send a "Resend/Checksum Incorrect " packet. If the same chunk does not match after three
attempts, the server will send an "Abort-after-3-incorrect-checksums" packet, close the file handle, and delete the
file.
For each received chunk, the server will check if the chunk size is correct. If the hash does not match, the server
will send a "Resend/Invalid Chunk size " packet. If the same chunk does not match after three attempts, the server
will send an "Abort-after-3-invalid-chunks" packet, close the file handle, and delete the file.
If chunk size and MD5 checksum are ok, server will send a "Status OK" packet back to client. The server will write
chunks to disk as it receives them until it receives a "Finished" packet from the client, at which point it will close
the file handle and leave the file on disk.
For deleting a file, client will send a Delete File packet to server. After receiving a “Delete File” packet for a file,
server will delete the file in <Current Working Directory/data> and update its META-DATA file, then send a Status
OK message back to client. Upon receiving this Status OK message, client will update its META-DATA file.
3.
Error Handling
A) Client lies to server about chunk size in the chunk packet.
The server will ask client to resend the chunk packet. After 3 wrong chunk packets the server will abort the current
file and terminate the connection.
B) Client dies during sending chunk packets.
The server will abort the current transactions and delete the file.
C) Client forgets to send the Finish packet.
This is one of signs that client doesn’t follow the protocol, server will drop the connection after a timeout of 30
seconds without receiving the Finish packet or receiving other packets instead of the Finish packet.
D) Client aborts an updating file.
During sending a file, client detect that the file is modified, then client sends an Abort message and will update the
file in the next round. Server will delete the file in this transaction.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES
Step 1. Implement the handshaking phase
It is similar as project 1, but you need to create/read the META-DATA at server side by reading the file information
in the <Current Working Directory/data>.
Step 2: Detect file updates
Instead of wake up your client after 20s, control your client by hitting ‘S’ or ‘s’ for sleeping, ‘W’ or ‘w’ for waking it
up.
1. Put your client into sleep
2. Create new file or deleting old file or modify existing files.
3. Print out files needed to update and what kinds of updates.
Step 3. Implement Keep-Alive message for NO UPDATE.
1. Put your client into sleep.
2. Wake up your client without any updates.
3. Print out the Keep-Alive messages that are sent and received.
Step 4: Implement Create/Modify files
As similar as project 1.
Step 5: Implement Deleting File
1.
2.
3.
Delete a file when the client is sleeping
Wake up your client
Use the command “ls” in the server to see if the server actually delete the file
Step 6: Error Handling Cases
A) Client lies to server about chunk size in the chunk packet.
nd
1. Create a malicious client that lies to server about chunk size in the 2 chunk packet. Then check if the client
receives the ReSend message from server. And make sure everything is fine after the client resend the correct
chunk packets.
The command line for this client is: ./bad-client1 <servername> <serverport> <folder name> <chunksize>
2. Create a malicious client that lies to server about chunk size in 3 continuous chunk packets. Then check if the
client receives the ReSend message from server. And make sure the server will delete the file and terminal the
connection.
The command line for this client is: ./bad-client2 <servername> <serverport> <folder name> <chunksize>
B) Client dies during sending chunk packets.
Try to send a large file to server. During the transfer time, terminate the client. Make sure that the server will abort
the current transactions and delete the file.
C) Client forgets to send the finish packet.
st
1. Create a malicious client that forget to send the Finish packet for the 1 file in an update round, but send the
chunk packet for other file. Create at least 2 files when client is sleeping. Make sure that server will terminal the
nd
connection after receiving the chunk packet for the 2 file.
2. Rerun the above client, but create only one file when client is sleeping. Make sure that server will terminal the
connection after the timeout of 30s.
The command line for this client is: ./bad-client3 <servername> <serverport> <folder name> <chunksize>
D) Client aborts an updating file.
Try to send a large file from client to server, but at client side, open the file with READONLY flag. During transfer
time, delete the file. It will cause a return error when client tries to read the deleted file. Make sure that client will
send the Abort File message.
Final Step: Integrate All Things Together
Implement the finite-state machine for client and server and put the client into sleep after every update round.
